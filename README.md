# CMSE 492 Tooling Check

This repository contains a simple Python script and Jupyter notebook used for the Day 01 in-class tooling check.

## Structure

- `src/hello_cmse492.py`: prints a hello message, then reads a small CSV file and prints a basic summary
- `notebooks/hello_cmse492.ipynb`: notebook version with separate cells for the hello message and CSV summary
- `data/sample_data.csv`: tiny dataset used by both the script and the notebook

## Quick start

```bash
python src/hello_cmse492.py
```

Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code to run the notebook version. The first code cell prints a hello message, and the next cell reads the CSV file and prints a summary.
